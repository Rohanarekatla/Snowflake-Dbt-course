## 1. Introduction
Developed in 2012, Snowflake is a fully managed SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that provides a single solution for:
- Data warehousing
- Data lakes
- Data engineering
- Data science
- Data application development
- Secure sharing and consumption of real-time or shared data

## 2. Traditional DWH Challenges
### Infrastructure Limitations
- IAAS: DWH was primarily focused on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS)
- Limited Storage Capacity: Despite having storage arrays, archival is required after specific periods
- High Cost: Storage disk expansion leads to increased costs
- Limited Processing Capability: Extended processing times due to Single Core machines or limited infrastructure
- No Scalability: Conventional databases cannot handle enormous data growth
- Hardware Issues: Aging hardware and frequent hardware failures
- Security Concerns: Multiple data sources create potential security vulnerabilities

## 3. Snowflake Overview
### True SaaS Platform
- No hardware (virtual or physical) to select, install, configure, or manage
- Virtually no software to install, configure, or manage
- Ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning handled by Snowflake

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Operates entirely on public cloud environments
- Uses cloud-native architecture
- Virtual compute instances for processing
- Storage service for persistent data storage
- Cannot run on private cloud infrastructures (on-premises or hosted)

## 4. Architecture

   - Security management

2. **Compute Layer**
   - Virtual warehouses (MPP compute clusters)
   - Query execution
   - Dynamic scaling
   - Multi-cluster capabilities
   - Standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Persistent storage using cloud blob storage
   - Supports AWS, Azure, and GCP
