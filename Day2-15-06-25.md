🧠 Snowflake – In-Depth Study Notes (Detailed & Interview-Ready)
1. Problems with Traditional Data Warehousing (DWH)
⚠️ Key Limitations:
Limited Storage Capacity:

Data must be archived after a specific period due to physical constraints.

Real-time access becomes impractical—especially critical in scientific applications.

High Cost:

Additional storage disks significantly increase costs.

Trade-off between storage expansion and budget.

Limited Processing Capability:

Processing time is slow due to single-core machines or limited infrastructure.

No Scalability:

Systems fail to scale effectively with data growth.

Conventional DBs not designed for enormous data workloads.

Aging Infrastructure:

Hardware failures are frequent due to outdated systems.

Data Security Risks:

Multiple data sources increase the attack surface.

Vulnerability to hacking due to inconsistent or weak security layers.

6. Snowflake Architectural Layers
A. Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses)
💡 Definition:
Virtual Warehouses (VW) are MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) compute clusters composed of multiple nodes.

📌 Key Features:
Each node stores a portion of data locally.

Can access any DB in storage layer (with permission).

Can be created, resized, suspended, resumed, deleted dynamically.

Transparent caching of frequently accessed data.

🔄 Resizing:
Can resize mid-operation.

Ongoing queries complete with original size; new queries use resized VW.

B. Storage Layer
🗂️ Details:
Centralized and persistent.

Hosted on scalable blob storage like AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP.

Automatically organizes data into compressed, columnar micro-partitions.

Stores structured and semi-structured formats.

💾 Uses:
Stores temp data from large queries or joins.

Holds large result sets.

Completely managed by Snowflake—no user effort required.

C. Cloud Services Layer
🧠 Responsibilities:
Infrastructure Management:

Start/suspend virtual warehouse clusters.

Metadata Management:

Store metadata required for:

Time travel

Cloning

Query performance

Query Optimization:

SQL optimizer with cost-based optimization (CBO)

Auto join-ordering and stats collection

Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Query parsing/evaluation (EXPLAIN plans run here without VWH)

7. Specialized Capabilities
🔁 Elasticity & Concurrency
Multi-cluster warehouses auto-scale for high-concurrency.

Example: 4-node VW takes 20 hrs → 32-node VW = 4 hrs (cost = same, time ↓).

🔐 Access Control Features
RBAC

Row Masking

Dynamic Masking

Network Policies

🧪 Data Science & ML Integration
External integration with:

PyTorch

TensorFlow

Hugging Face

Tooling:

Snowpark

Notebooks

Streamlit

📤 Data Sharing
Secure, real-time sharing without copying/movement

Works even with non-Snowflake users

📚 Cortex AI Capabilities
Built-in tools for:

LLM (Large Language Model) functions

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Document AI

AI-enhanced Search

8. Data Operations & Serverless Features
Feature	Description
Snowpipe	Continuous, automated data loading
Materialized Views	Persistent views with performance boost
Serverless Tasks	Event-based scheduled jobs
Search Optimization	Faster lookups via indexing-like mechanism
Auto Clustering	Maintains physical storage layout efficiently

9. Time Travel & Fail-Safe
Time Travel:

Retrieve previous states of data.

Supports up to 90 days retention.

Fail-Safe:

Last-resort recovery after time-travel expires.

10. Cloning & Caching
Zero-Copy Cloning:

Snapshot of schema/table/DB at a point-in-time.

No duplication of physical storage.

Caching Mechanisms:

Result Cache: Remembers previous query results.

Data Cache: Speeds up access to commonly used data.

11. Replication & Global Availability
Region-to-region replication for disaster recovery.

Supports cross-cloud, cross-region deployment.

Business Continuity & HA (High Availability) included.

12. Comparison with Other DWs
🔁 Redshift
Ideal for:

Continuous computation

Examples: NASDAQ reports, real-time bidding

Requires infrastructure tuning.

🔁 BigQuery

Spiky workloads (occasional heavy queries)

Examples: Daily recommendation engines, quarterly reports

🔁 Snowflake
Ideal for:

Continuous workloads and BI

Examples: Multi-tenant BI apps, DaaS platforms
